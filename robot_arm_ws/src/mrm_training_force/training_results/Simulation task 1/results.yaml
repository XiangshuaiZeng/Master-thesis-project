weights on the rewards: 300 for target-reaching and 0.2 for obstacle-avoiding

success_rate with noise on action: 58/100
             without:  41/100     

The noise on the action gave some randomness to the movement so that the suitations where the robot is stuck decrease.

It is observed that most of the time when the target is not reached, it is because the target position is too far away. However, the robotic arm should be able to touch it within that distance, the problem is the second and the third joints stop moving after some distance is reached. It seems the exploration is not enough.

---------------------------------------------------------------

model2: 
/PPO_model/turning_left_various_angles1.ckpt

weights on the rewards: 500 for target-reaching and 0.2 for obstacle-avoiding

target distance: the area where the target is randomly placed is farther than that in model1

Other parameters: same as before

success_rate with noise on action: 81/100
             without:  72/100

Training time: 3 hours
 
---------------------------------------------------------------

model3: 
/PPO_model/turning_left_various_angles2.ckpt

parameters: all of the setups are the same except the diameter of the pipe is reduced from 140mm to 125mm.

success_rate with noise on action: %
             without:  %

Training time: 3 hours

-------------------------------------------------------------------

model4: 
/PPO_model/turning_left_various_angles3.ckpt

parameters: all of the setups are the same as in model2 except the turning angle is between 60 and 120 degrees.

success_rate with noise on action: 76/100
             without:  56/100

Training time: 3 hours

Remarks: it is much easier for the arm to be at a locked position when the action is without noise.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

model5: 
/PPO_model/turning_left_various_angles4.ckpt

parameters: all of the setups are the same as in model3 except the penalty from the laser scanner is higher

weights on the rewards: 500 for target-reaching and 0.8 for obstacle-avoiding

success_rate with noise on action: 80/100
             without:  44/100

Training time: 3 hours

Remarks: it is found in the validation that the end-effedctor is very "unwilling" to get close to the pipe so that the other parts of the robotic arm become easier to hit the pipe; so in the next model, I decide to decrease the coefficient on the penalty for laser data. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

model6: 
/PPO_model/turning_left_various_angles5.ckpt

parameters: same as model4 except the diameter is decreased to 125mm; the target is even farther and the friction between the pipe and the robot is reduced from 0.1 to 0.02 (values for mu1, mu2); also number of iterations is increased.

weights on the rewards: 500 for target-reaching and 0.3 for obstacle-avoiding


success_rate with noise on action: /100
             without:   26/100   (due to the arm is stuck at some point)

Training time: 3 hours

Remarks: the robotic arm cannot touch the target because there is always collisions happening after the end-effctor reaches some certain distance.  It seems the reduction of frection does not work, I have go to next phase.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

model7: 
/PPO_model/turning_left_various_angles6.ckpt

parameters: same as model5 except the reward changes from Huber loss to Ln loss

weights on the rewards: 1.6 for target-reaching and 0.3 for obstacle-avoiding

success_rate with noise on action: /100
             without:   /100  

Training time: 3 hours

Remarks: it is not like the longer the training, the better the model will be. Sometimes too much learning might overfit the policy.
Remember to test the best model in pipes with different angles and diameters

TRPO:

model1: 
/TRPO_model/turning_left_various_angles.ckpt

parameters: same as PPO model1

success_rate with noise on action: 42%
             without:  26%  

TRPO model is easier to make the robot stuck in the pipe
